# it's technically one line, right?

## AssSorter

Small Rust-written App to sort lists. Uses Druid for GUI.
It has options for both BubbleSort and QuickSort.

Smol project as I develop several other things e.g. my game, Hololive-inspired tools (this is because I have crippling commitment issues)

### Why is the code horribly compact and single-line?

idk im insane

## As an apology
I also added a better-formatted version, it's the same except some text changes

## What did I learn from this
So apparently you can hide the command window by adding ```#![windows_subsystem = "windows"]``` so that's useful for BAUx2
